## :spider: Run instructions (Linux environment)

* Download this GitHub repository, and unzip the project folder
* Edit the **``WATCHLIST_INPUT_FILE.txt``** according to the specific project requirements    
* Upload the project folder to your profile on a High Performance Computer (HPC) of choice
* Access a node of the HPC that has access to the Internet (since GBIF downloads require an Internet connection), e.g ``ssh cvansteenderen@globus.chpc.ac.za``
* cd (change the directory) to the relevant folder/directory on your HPC profile
* Add the most recent version of R as a module, e.g. ``module load chpc/BIOMODULES R/4.2.0``
* Run ``nohup Rscript get_synonyms.R &> get_synonyms.out &`` to search for all the available synonyms for each species on GBIF      
* Run ``Rscript prep.R`` to prepare the required input files for the analysis
* Run ``nohup Rscript KG_run_setup.R &> KG_run_setup.out &`` to start downloading from GBIF
* Run ``chmod +x split_gbif.sh`` to make the **split_gbif.sh** shell script executable
* Run ``./split_gbif.sh`` to run **split_gbif.sh**, which divides the large GBIF zipped folder into multiple small CSV files/chunks that are more manageable (i.e. can be read into R!)
* Run ``nohup Rscript KG_run.R &> KG_run.out &`` to apply broad-scale climate matching for each smaller file, and collate them all again at the end

./split_gbif.sh      
nohup Rscript KG_run.R &> KG_run.out &      
```

üí°The nohup part of the code means "no hangup", and allows the user to run additional tasks while the previous task is running, and/or keeps the code running even if the user logs off the HPC

## ü™≤ Workflow

This collection of R scripts follows the pipeline below:

* Input an Excel file containing a list of the genus and species names of invasive organisms of interest (e.g. from the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species [GRIIS](https://griis.org/) database)    
* Input the name of a country that is under potential threat from these species (focal country)     
* Remove all (1) all taxa already recorded in the focal country, and (2) endemic species (if available) from the list       
* Input a list of the K√∂ppen-Geiger zones present in the focal country      
* Download all occurence records from GBIF for the taxa in the input list      
* Extract the KG climate zone for each occurence record (GPS location)     
* Score whether the KG zones where the invasive species occur are shared with the KG zones present in the focal country (0 or 1)    
* Score the total number of records per species that share a KG zone with the focal country, and the overall proportion        
* Score the total, and proportion of, records present in each target KG zone, and also record whether there are any records from the focal country already      
* Output a single summary table    
  
üí°The only file that the user needs to change is ``WATCHLIST_INPUT_FILE.txt``. If specific changes need to be made to the filtering of the invasive species list before it is processed (e.g. more than one taxonomic kingdom, such as Plantae AND Animalia), then edits can be made in the ``get_synonyms.R`` file.

## Troubleshooting

‚ö†Ô∏è There may be times when the GBIF database is down or experiencing errors. For example, the error:    
``Timeout was reached: [occurrence-download.gbif.org] SSL/TLS connection timeout``, or        
``OpenSSL SSL_connect: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL in connection to api.gbif.org:443`` might appear.    
Check the progress of the script run regularly. If an error occurred, write the latest version of the ``super_table`` object to the project directory as a CSV file, and create a new subset of your species list file from the last species that was processed. Use this as the new input, and re-run the script

‚ö†Ô∏è If a GBIF file is too large to read back into the R environment, an error might pop up saying something like this:    
``Opened 23.69GB (25433215792 bytes) file ok but could not memory map it. This is a 64bit process. There is probably not enough contiguous virtual memory available``    
Search the R script for the following line:    
``import_back_file <- rgbif::occ_download_import(result, nrows = 500000)``, and change ``nrows`` to a smaller value. Rerun the script, which now limits the number of rows read in. Alternatively, change the ``keep.downloads`` parameter in the INPUT.csv file to ``n``, which will automatically delete each downloaded folder after the relevant information has been extracted

‚ö†Ô∏è If your Internet connection is unstable, you might get the error:    
``Error occurred while fetching usageKey for species_name : any(content_types == "application/json") is not TRUE ``    
Ensure that you are running this R script on a computer that has uninterrupted Internet access and electricity supply

## üêù Input file

Below is a template and an example of the **``WATCHLIST_INPUT_FILE.txt``** file that the user needs to edit accordingly. The name **WATCHLIST_INPUT_FILE** should not be changed, and neither should any of the parameters in capital letters in the file. Check the species list csv file for the project to ensure the correct usage of the target country and taxonomic kingdom, and make sure that there is a single column in the file with both the genus and species name (no authority or other detail); for example ``Acacia saligna``, or ``Opuntia stricta``. The column name can be anything - here it is set to ``accepted_name.species``. Ensure that the same requirements are met for the file containing endemic species (if available); here it is ``full.tax.name``. If a list of endemics is not available, leave ``ENDEMICS LIST PATH`` and ``ENDEMICS NAME COLUMN`` blank. Enter the applicable K√∂ppen-Geiger zones as numbers (see below for codes), separated by a comma. The file paths provided can be anything you like - just make sure that the relevant data is available at the path you have specified.

## ü¶§ Example output

In the example, the focal country is Mauritius (``MU``). The KG zones in this country are ``1, 2, 3, 14``, which correspond to Af (tropical rainforest), Am (tropical monsoon), Aw (tropical savannah), and Cfa (humid subtropical), respectively.

An example output **final_sp_table.csv** might be (showing just the first two species):

| species | total_n | total_records_in_kg | prop_records_in_kg | total_records_in_1 | prop_records_in_1 | total_records_in_2 | prop_records_in_2 | total_records_in_3 | prop_records_in_3 | total_records_in_14 | prop_records_in_14 | total_records_in_15 | prop_records_in_15 | n_records_in_target_countries | citation | mins | size.mb |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Abelmoschus moschatus | 1389 | 1073 | 77.25 | 349 | 25.126 | 176 | 12.671 | 372 | 26.782 | 165 | 11.879 | 11 | 0.792 | 19 | https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.frq6xw | 2.15 | 8.2 |
| Abies alba | 68628 | 23643 | 34.45 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0.001 | 195 | 0.28 | 23447 | 34.17 | 0 | https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.h57gnu | 12.74 | 18.31 |

This table indicates that there were 1389 *A. moschatus* species downloaded from GBIF, and that 1073 of these shared KG zone/s with the KG zones present in Mauritius and Reunion (77%). Approximately 25% of the species records fell into KG zone 1, 13% in zone 2, 27% in zone 3, 12% in zone 14, and 1% in zone 15. A total of 19 of the 1389 records were already present in these two countries (1.4%). The GBIF doi is recorded, the time taken in minutes for each species to download, and the size of the data folder in megabytes. *Abies alba* seems to pose a lower threat, as only 34.5% of its records occurred in KG zones present in MU and RE. The bulk of these records (34.2%) came from KG zone 15 (temperate, no dry season, warm summer).

To create thresholded lists, one can read in the output table and subset it:

```{r}
full.table = read.csv("results/summary/supertable_full.csv")

# set the threshold for the total proportion of shared KG climates
thresh = 95

# filter such that only species with 50 or more occurrence records are kept
# save this list
full.table.thresh = dplyr::filter(full.table, prop_records_in_kg >= thresh & 
                                      total_n >= 50)

# rename columns accordingly for optional ggplots
full.table.thresh.subset = full.table.thresh %>% 
  dplyr::select(species, contains("prop_records_in"), -prop_records_in_kg) %>%
  dplyr::rename(Af = prop_records_in_1,
                Am = prop_records_in_2,
                Aw = prop_records_in_3,
                Cfa = prop_records_in_14,
                Cfb = prop_records_in_15)

# prepare for ggplot
full.table.thresh.long = reshape2::melt(full.table.thresh.subset) 

climate.bars = ggplot(data = full.table.thresh.long, 
                      # reorder puts them in descending order
                      aes(x = reorder(species, -value), y = value, fill = variable)) +
  # use dodge to not stack

  labs(title = paste0("KG similarity over ", thresh, "% (n = ", num.spp.thresh, ")"),
       x = "Species",
       y = "Proportion of Records (%)",
       fill = "KG climate zone") +
